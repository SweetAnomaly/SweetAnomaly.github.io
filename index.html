        <h1> Hi Audri, I made this webpage hoping to express how 
            I felt over the last sem... <br>
            Hindi ako masyadong eager umattend sa klase,
        I was just grappling to go through it every week, maliban nalang tuwing
    tuesday and thursday. Lagi kong inaanticipate yung dalawang araw na yun every week.
I'm not exactly certain of what may have caused these sentiments.
Alam ko na hindi tayo close, but I've found some appreciation for your presence.
Sa susunod na acad year wala na tayong similar na klase, at dahil sa differing 
schedules, magkaibang courses, at sa laki ng campus, I figured malaki ang chance na hinda na ulit kita makikita. 
I like you. Siguro gusto ko lang malaman mo yun, and malaman ko rin if there's ever a chance
we could be close in some manner. In any case, I know this is awkward,
so you are free to disregard or completely ignore this. Good luck sa third year :)) <br><br>
